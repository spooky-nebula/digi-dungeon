# Digi Dungeon

Your beginner helper for D&D. It is meant for beginner players and GMs with small experience in D&D.

## FAQs

### What stage are we in right now?

We have the application's features set on paper, available over on Jira (private board for now)

### Can you depend on this project to be done for your campaign?

No, this project will still take a while to work on with a small team.

### Why make this?

I felt like D&DBeyond has great features for local play but is harder to use online while something like Roll20 has great features for playing online but lacks the easy access that D&DBeyond has, so I decided to make this with some friends. This application will also have some features that would help with new players like easy to glance icons, scripted character sheets, travel calculations, drag-and-drop items, grid-like combat and traveling and so much more down the line.

### Is this going to be cross-platform?

Yes! Fortunately I have Windows, Linux and MacOS, so I'll be able to produce for any of the platforms and test. It's also a Web Application, so it should work on any device that supports javascript browsing.

### How can I contribute?

Right now you can suggest enhancements using the issue boards on GitHub.
